        <p> <img class="float_right" src="castle_crags.JPG" width="300" > <strong>Welcome. </strong>   I am an electrical engineering student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I'm excited to be graduating this June, 2018 and entering industry.</p>
        <p> My interests are in analog design and control systems. Currently, my senior design team is working on a corporate sponsored project that uses feedback control to control motion for an OLED printer head.  
        <p> I have a broad interest in EE and CE: the curriculum itself is broad, and I've taken courses ranging from Verilog and logic design to advanced CMOS IC design, RF hardware, and DSP. </p>
        <p> In this site I've included my resume,brief project descriptions, and the best way to reach me. </p>
        <p>Also I love all the mountains in California, and I've included photos of hiking trips I've taken, including on the  John Muir Trail .</p>

    <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
    <p> I've gained much practical experience working with analog design. I now have the confidence and ability to go from research of a design 
to acquiring the components to putting together a prototype and then of course it doesn't work...trouble shooting has me in the lab for hours. My project 
experience includes a mix of analog and digital designs. </p>  

    <h4> AM Radio Receiver </h4>

    <p> This Winter 2018 I designed an built an AM Radio Receiver on a PCB tuned for 1460 kHz. After researching receiver design and thoroughly understanding the necessary components, I designed using industry standard tools Orcad Schematic Capture and PCB Layout. An entire quarter was devoted to learning the use of these tools, and I've gained much practical experience with them. As engineers, the tools we have access to is amazing and powerful.</p>
    <p> This has so far been an excercise in trouble shooting, but the circuit is workable. Currently the mixer works beautifully and is precisely tuned. The entire mixer/demodulation stage offers a solid 40dBm of gain, which is perfect for RF. However, an oscillatory gain IF gain stage was identified using an oscilloscope. One solution that has yet to be tested involves RF chokes on the gate bias network. This will be tested as soon as my campus lab opens up, but I'm confident it will fix the issue. </p>
    <p> This project has stoked my passion for analog design and given me practical experience in using the tools associated with RF. As a licensed ham radio operator, I am learning more about communications technology, and hope to build my own station in the future. 

    <h4> Feedback System for Motion Control </h4>

    <p> My senior design project has put me onto the practical side of control theory. I was excited to join this team, especially right after finishing a Feedback Control course at UCSC.  I am part of the five member senior design team designing a motion control project that models our corporate sponsor's
OLED printing machinery. 
    <p> The design uses an Arduino Uno to sense position of a weighted air cylinder. Position is fed back and compared to a desired
        setpoint position (negative feedback), and the air pressure of the cylinder is adjusted until an error margin is met.</p>
    <p> The current design uses a PID algorithm which, when tuned, gives less than a 5 second settling time. 
    <p> One of the problems is this system must be tuned. The machinery used in industry are all different, even within a single company: the cylinder may have different frictional forces acting on it, and may hold different weights. The current PID approach takes time to tune each control parameter for each individual system. This final quarter, we are seeking to eliminate this tuning time. My main task will be to implement a least squares estimation technique into an algorithm that both improves the settling time and can apply generally to other systems with different machinery, weight, etc.</p>
