        <h2>Jordan Eric Tapia</h2>
        <p> <img class="float_right" src="castle_crags.JPG" width="300" > <strong>Welcome.</strong>Part of my summer 2017 to-do list has been to build my first website from scratch. I've enjoyed putting some HTML and CSS together to initiate my own personal marketing campaign. </p>
        <p> I am an electrical engineering  undergrad at University of California Santa Cruz. I've sought to gain a broad perspective of the field, so I have taken courses that delve deep in both CE and EE including Advanced logic design with verilog, advanced CMOS design, and VLSI. In addition, RF Design will be taken in my next/final year.</p>
        <p> In this site i've included some description of projects I've worked on while at school. </p>
        <p>Also I love all the mountains in California, and I've included photos of hiking trips I've taken, including on the  JMT .</p>
